# Media Server

Generates HTML output that looks something like expected_output.txt


## Getting Started

Having ripped my CDs to disk, I would like to run a media server on my home network. My initial version, the so-called minimum viable product, is an HTML web page with a list of the albums by artist and a list of links to each track, like this. When the user clicks a link to an audio file, the browser will automagically play the music.


### Prerequisites

Bash
Perl
Unix


## Running the tests

Run music.pl (perl script) and/or bash script to get expected output


## Built With

* [Perl](https://www.perl.org/get.html) - highly capable, feature-rich language
* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) - Unix shell and command language
